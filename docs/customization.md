**Note: following guide is updated to match latest released version.**

TinyPedal offers a wide range of customization options for `widget` and `module` controls, which can be accessed from corresponding tabs in main window.

# Global user configuration
TinyPedal stores global user configuration in `config.json` file, which is used for none-preset specific options.

* For Windows, `config.json` is stored under `username\AppData\Roaming\TinyPedal` folder.
* For Linux, `config.json` is stored under `home/username/.config/TinyPedal` folder.

Available settings:

* `Application`, can be accessed from `Config` menu in main window, see [Application](#application) section for details.
* `Telemetry API`, can be accessed from `API` menu in main window, see [Telemetry API](#telemetry-api) section for details.
* `Compatibility`, can be accessed from `Config` menu in main window, see [Compatibility](#compatibility) section for details.
* `User path`, can be accessed from `Config` menu in main window, see [User Path](#user-path) section for details.
* `Auto load preset`, can be accessed from `Preset` tab in main window, see [Preset Management](#preset-management) section for details.

Reload or Restart:

* To reload all presets, select `Reload` from `Overlay` menu in main window.
* To restart game API, select `Restart API` from `API` menu in main window.
* To restart TinyPedal, select `Restart TinyPedal` from `Window` menu in main window.

# Preset management
TinyPedal stores all customization options in `JSON` format preset files, and can be managed from `Preset` tab in main window.

All user preset files, by default, are located in `TinyPedal\settings` folder. Those `JSON` files can also be manually edited with text editor.

`Double-Click` on a preset name in `Preset` tab to load selected preset.

Click `Transfer` button to transfer settings from currently loaded preset to another preset. See [Preset Transfer](#preset-transfer) section for details.

`Right-Click` on a preset name in `Preset` tab opens up a context menu that provides additional preset file management options:

* Lock Preset

    Lock selected preset, which prevents any changes that made through TinyPedal from saving to locked preset file. APP `version` tag will be attached to the preset that is locked with.

    Note, this feature does not prevent user from modifying or deleting locked preset file by other means. Locked preset file info is stored in `config.lock` file in [Global User Configuration](#global-user-configuration) folder.

* Unlock Preset

    Unlock selected preset.

* Set Primary for Class

    Add primary `class` tag to selected preset, which will be auto loaded by `Auto load preset` system. Class tags and colors are defined in `classes.json` file, which can be modified in [Vehicle Class Editor](#vehicle-class-editor).

    Note, a single preset can have tags from multiple classes. Auto loading `primary class` preset (if available) always takes priority over `primary sim`.

* Clear Primary Tag

    Clear all primary tags from selected preset.

* Duplicate

    Duplicate selected preset with a new name.

* Rename

    Rename selected preset with a new name. This option is not available for locked preset.

* Delete

    Delete selected preset with confirmation. This option is not available for locked preset.

## Saving JSON file
TinyPedal automatically saves setting when user makes changes to widget position, or has toggled widget visibility, auto-hide, overlay-lock, etc. Changes will only take effect after `Reload` preset, or clicked `Save` or `Apply` button in `Config` dialog, or `Restart` APP.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Backup JSON file
TinyPedal will automatically create backup file with time stamp suffix if old setting file fails to load, and new default `JSON` with same filename will be generated.

A newer released version will auto-update old setting and add new setting after loading. It may still be a good idea to manually backup files before upgrading to newer version.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Editing JSON file
Customization can be done through various configuration dialogs and menus from main window. Manual editing `JSON` file is not recommended.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Preset Transfer
**Preset transfer dialog is used for transferring settings from one preset to another.**

Note, you can only transfer settings from a currently loaded preset to another preset, this is done to ensure one-way transfer.

**A confirmation dialog will be shown before transfer.**

It is recommended to first load a preset, then unhide the preset and double-check if you wish to transfer its settings to another preset.

**For important preset, it is recommended to make a backup copy, and/or lock the preset.**

To transfer settings from currently loaded preset to another specific preset, select a preset name from preset selector on the top right. Locked presets are not available from preset selector.

To select one or more settings, select and check setting name from `Setting` list on the left side. Only selected settings will be transferred.

To select one or more option types, select and check option type name from `Option Type` list on the right side. Only selected options will be transferred.

To select or deselect all settings or option types from list, click `All` or `None` button on list header.

Option types:
- Enable State: widget or module enable state.
- Feature Toggle: widget or module feature enable state, such as `enable_XXX` or `show_XXX`.
- Update Interval: widget or module update interval and idle update interval.
- Position: widget position.
- Opacity: widget opacity.
- Layout: widget layout.
- Color: color options.
- Font: font name, font weight, font size options.
- Column Index: column index options.
- Decimal Places: decimal places options.
- Other Options: all other options that are not part of above option types.

For example, to only transfer all widgets `position` setting to another preset, select and check all settings from `Setting` list on the left side, then select only `position` from `Option Type` list on the right side, and click `Transfer` button.

**These are the commonly used setting terms and keywords.**

    enable
Check whether a widget or module will be loaded at startup.

    update_interval
Set refresh rate for widget or module in milliseconds. A value of `20` means refreshing every 20ms, which equals 50fps. Since most data from sharedmemory plugin is capped at 50fps, and most operation system has a roughly 15ms minimum sleep time, setting value less than `10` has no benefit, and extreme low value may result significant increase of CPU usage.

    idle_update_interval
Set refresh rate for module while idling for conserving resources.

    position_x, position_y
Define widget position on screen in pixels. Those values will be auto updated and saved.

    opacity
Set opacity for entire widget. By default, all widgets have a 90% opacity setting, which equals value `0.9`. Lower value adds more transparency to widget. Acceptable value range in `0.0` to `1.0`. Note, opacity can also be set by adjusting alpha value in `color` options for individual elements.

    bar_gap, inner_gap
Set gap (screen pixel) between elements in a widget, only accept integer, `1` = 1 pixel.

    font_name
Select a font to be displayed in widget. Mono type font is highly recommended.

Note, selected font must be already installed in operation system; if not, manually install required font. Default fallback font will be used if font is not found or installed in operation system.

    *_offset_x, *_offset_y
Set text offset position (percentage), value range in `0.0` to `1.0`.

    bar_padding
Set widget edge padding value that multiplies and scales with `font_size`. Default is `0.2` for most widgets. Increase padding value will further increase each element width in widget.

    color
Set color in hexadecimal color codes with alpha value (opacity). The color code format starts with `#`, then follows by two-digit hexadecimal numbers for each channel in the order of `alpha`, `red`, `green`, `blue`. Note, `alpha` is optional and can be omitted. User can select a new color without manual editing, by double-clicking on color entry box in `Config` dialog.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Fuel calculator
**Fuel calculator can be accessed from `Tools` menu in main window.**

Fuel value and unit symbol depend on `Fuel Unit` setting from [Units](#units) config dialog, `L` = liter, `gal` = gallon. Virtual energy unit is `%` = percentage. Note, after changed `Fuel Unit` setting, it is required to close and reopen `Fuel calculator` in order to update units info for calculation.

    Calculation panel
On the left side is calculation panel, which handles `fuel` and `virtual energy` usage calculation and results display.

This panel also includes a vertical `pit stop preview` bar on the left, which visualizes pit stops as blue marks and stint laps as grey marks. Each pit stop mark shows a reference lap completion number. Total estimated number of race laps is displayed at bottom of the bar.

Note, when `Energy consumption` value is higher than zero, pit stops and stint laps from preview bar will be calculated based on energy usage. Stint lap mark may not be displayed if there is not enough space to draw.

    Consumption history table
On the right side is consumption history table, which lists `lap number`, `lap time`, `fuel consumption`, `virtual energy consumption`, `fuel ratio`, `battery drain`, `battery regen`, `battery net change`, `average tyre tread wear`, `tank capacity` columns from [Consumption History](#consumption-history) data. Invalid lap time or consumption data is highlighted in red. Nonessential column can be hidden (or shown) by right-click on table header and select corresponding column name.

Click `Load Live` button to load or update consumption history from live session to history table and automatically fill in latest data to calculator.

Click `Load File` button to load data from specific consumption history file to history table and automatically fill in latest data to calculator.

Loaded data source and track and class name will be displayed on status bar.

Select one or more `Time`, `Fuel`, `Energy`, `Tyre`, `Tank` values from history table and click `Add selected data` button to send value to calculator.

Select multiple values from history table and click `Add selected data` button to calculate average reading of selected values and send to calculator.

    Lap time
Set lap time in `minutes` : `seconds` : `milliseconds` format. Values are automatically carried over between spin boxes when exceeded minimum or maximum value range. This value can be retrieved from `Time` column.

    Tank capacity
Set vehicle fuel tank capacity. This value can be retrieved from `Tank` column.

    End stint fuel, End stint energy
Show remaining fuel or energy at the end of stint.

    Total pit stops
Show total number of pit stops required to finish race. First value is raw reading with decimal places, second value behind `≈` sign is rounded up integer reading.

Note, sometimes when `Average pit seconds` is set to longer duration, ceiling integer reading may be rounded up `2` units higher than raw reading, this is not an error. For example, it may show `5.978 ≈ 7` instead of `5.978 ≈ 6`, this is because when calculating from `6` pit stops, due to less amount time spent in pit stop compare to `7`, more fuel is required per pit stop which would exceed tank capacity, hence calculator adds 1 more pit stop.

    One less pit stop
Show theoretical fuel or energy consumption in order to make one less pit stop.

    Total laps, Total minutes
Show total laps and minutes can run based on `Total race fuel` or `Total race energy` value.

Show maximum laps and minutes can run per stint based on `Tank capacity` value (or 100% capacity for virtual energy).

    Starting fuel, Starting energy
Set amount fuel or energy to carry at the starting of race (first stint). This value affects `Total race fuel (or energy)` and `Total pit stops` calculation, and is used for calculating `Average refueling` or `Average replenishing` per pit stop. Maximum value cannot exceed `Tank capacity` for fuel (or `100%` for energy). If value is set to `0` (default), `Tank capacity` value will be used as starting fuel (or `100%` for starting energy) for `Average refueling` calculation.

    Average refueling, Average replenishing
Show average refueling or replenishing per pit stop, and display warning color if value exceeds `Tank capacity` (fuel) or `100%` (energy).

    Starting tyre tread
Set average starting tyre tread (percent). For example, 100% for new tyres, and less for worn tyres.

    Tread wear per lap
Set average tyre tread wear (percent) per lap. This value can be retrieved from `Tyre` column.

    Tread wear per stint
Show total average tyre tread wear (percent) per stint. Note, while virtual energy is available, this value will be calculated based on the least `maximum stint laps` between fuel and virtual energy.

    Lifespan laps, Lifespan minutes
Show total tyre lifespan in laps and minutes based on `tread wear per lap` and `lap time`.

    Lifespan stints
Show estimated tyre lifespan in number of stints. Note, while virtual energy is available, this value will be calculated based on the least `maximum stint laps` between fuel and virtual energy.

## Track notes editor
**Track notes editor allows to create and edit track or pace notes, which can be accessed from `Tools` menu in main window.**

Note, by default the editor starts in `Pace Notes` edit mode as displayed in status bar.

**Important notes:** The editor does not provide `undo` function, it is recommended to save file before doing heavy modification.

The editor consists of two panel views:
* Left panel is the `Track Map Viewer`, which can be used to visualize track map and providing analytic info for assisting notes creation. See [Track Map Viewer](#track-map-viewer) section for details.

* Right panel is the track and pace notes editor, which allows to create, open, and save track or pace notes file.

The table view consists of multiple columns:
* `distance` column defines track position (in meters) of a note line.

* `pace note` column (in Pace Notes edit mode) defines `pace note` name that is used to match pace note sound file name.\
Note, DO NOT write file extension (format) in `pace note` column. File extension should be set in `Pace Notes` control panel tab from main window.

* `track note` column (in Track Notes edit mode) defines track-specific notes, such as `corner name` or `section name`.

* `tags` column attaches tags to specific notes, which will only be displayed or played under specific scenario. Currently the available tag is `#pit`. Notes that without `#pit` tag will not be displayed in pit lane.

* `comment` column defines optional extra info for `pace note` or `track note` column for user. Note, a comment can be broken into multiple lines by adding `\n` to any part of the comment.

To create or open pace notes, click `File` and select `New Pace Notes` or `Open Pace Notes`.

To create or open track notes, click `File` and select `New Track Notes` or `Open Track Notes`.

To save notes file, click `Save`. Note, notes file name should exactly match with track name from track map file name for `auto notes loading` function to work. The editor will try to retrieve track name automatically in an active session, or from an opened track map in `Track Map Viewer`.

To save notes file to other formats or for used in other games, select a file format name from `save type` in save dialog, such as `GPL Pace Notes (*.ini)` which saves pace notes in GPL pace notes file format. Note, only `TinyPedal` notes file formats are supported for used in TinyPedal.

# Modules
Modules provide important data that updated in real-time for other widgets. Widgets may stop updating or receiving readings if corresponding modules were turned off. Each module can be configured by accessing `Config` button from `Module` tab in main window.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Delta module
**This module provides deltabest and timing data.**

    module_delta
Enable delta module.

    minimum_delta_distance
Set minimum recording distance (in meters) between each lap time sample. Default value is `5` meters. Lower value may result more samples recorded and bigger file size; higher value may result less samples recorded and inaccuracy. Recommended value range in `5` to `10` meters.

    delta_smoothing_samples
Set number of samples for reducing data fluctuation. Higher value results more smoothness, but may lose accuracy. Default is `30` samples. Set to `1` to disable smoothing.

    laptime_pace_samples
Set number of samples for average laptime pace calculation. Default is `6` samples. Set `1` to disable averaging. Note, initial laptime pace is always based on player's all time personal best laptime if available. If a new laptime is faster than current laptime pace, it will replace current laptime pace without calculating average. Invalid lap, pit-in/out laps are always excluded from laptime pace calculation.

    laptime_pace_margin
Set additional margin for laptime pace that cannot exceed the sum of previous `laptime pace` and `margin`. This option is used to minimize the impact of unusually slow laptime. Default value is `5` seconds. Minimum value is limited to `0.1`.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Force module

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Hybrid module
**This module provides vehicle battery usage and electric motor data.**

    module_hybrid
Enable hybrid module.

    minimum_delta_distance
Set minimum recording distance (in meters) between each battery charge usage sample. Default value is `5` meters. Lower value may result more samples recorded and bigger file size; higher value may result less samples recorded and inaccuracy. Recommended value range in `5` to `10` meters.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Mapping module
**This module records and processes track map data.**

    module_mapping
Enable mapping module.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Notes module
**This module processes track and pace notes data.**

    module_notes
Enable notes module.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Relative module

    module_relative
Enable relative module.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Sectors module
**This module provides sectors timing data.**

    module_sectors
Enable sectors module.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Stats module
**This module records driver stats data.**

**Important notes:** Driver stats will not be recorded while:
- `enable_player_index_override` or `enable_active_state_override` option is enabled in [Telemetry API](#telemetry-api).
- `Single instance mode` is disabled via [Command Line Arguments](#command-line-arguments).

Stats are only saved when driver returned to garage.

    module_stats
Enable stats module.

    vehicle_classification
Set one of the three vehicle classifications where stats will be saved.

`Class - Brand` saves corresponding stats under class and brand name. Make sure to use [Vehicle Brand Editor](#vehicle-brand-editor) to import brand name. If brand name does not exist, only class name will be used instead.

`Class` saves corresponding stats under class name only.

`Vehicle` saves corresponding stats under vehicle name only. Saving stats under vehicle name is not recommended, because each single vehicle in `RF2` or `LMU` uses unique vehicle name, which will result multiple records of the same vehicle.

    enable_podium_by_class
Enable to count race finish position by class instead of overall position.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Stint module
**This module provides lap and stint history data.**

    module_stint
Enable stint module.

    minimum_stint_threshold_minutes
Set the minimum stint time threshold in minutes for concluding current stint. This only affects ESC.

    minimum_pitstop_threshold_seconds
Set the minimum pit stop time threshold in seconds for concluding current stint. Default is `3` seconds.

This option is useful for detecting pit stop that does not refuel or change tyres. It also allows to detect pit stop while spectating other player with [Spectate Mode](#spectate-mode).

    minimum_tyre_temperature_threshold
Set the minimum tyre carcass temperature (Celsius) threshold for calculating lap time delta and consistency. Default is `55` degrees.

This option helps to exclude slow lap time due to cold tyres from calculation.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Vehicles module
**This module provides additional processed vehicles data.**

    module_vehicles
Enable vehicles module.

    lap_difference_ahead_threshold
Lap difference (percentage) threshold for tagging opponents as ahead. Default is `0.9` lap.

    lap_difference_behind_threshold
Lap difference (percentage) threshold for tagging opponents as behind. Default is `0.9` lap.

    finish_time_difference_threshold
Set estimated finish time difference threshold between race leader and local player for determine the shortest race length (either in laps or time). Default threshold is `200` seconds (roughly a lap at LeMans).

- When finish time difference is lower than threshold, shortest race length is determined by player's lap time pace. This is useful for compensating strategy difference within the same leading class, and potentially catching up with leader.
- When finish time difference is higher than threshold, shortest race length is determined by leader's lap time pace. This is useful for much slower classes to align their finish time towards the leading class.

This option is used for adaptive race length and fuel calculation for `Lap` or `Laps & Time` finish criteria based race, which automatically determines the shortest race length and calculates fuel usage accordingly for increased accuracy and efficiency. This option only affects `Lap` or `Laps & Time` based race. `Time` based race is not affected by this option.

Unlike `Time` based race, finish criteria in `Laps & Time` based race is determined by both `remaining laps` and `remaining time` (whichever reaches zero first), such as seen from Qatar 1812km event.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Wheels module
**This module provides wheel radius, slip ratio, tyre wear, brake wear data.**

    minimum_axle_rotation
Set minimum axle rotation (radians per second) for calculating wheel radius and differential locking percent. Default value is `4`.

    maximum_rotation_difference_front, maximum_rotation_difference_rear
Set maximum rotation difference between left or right wheel rotation and same axle rotation for limiting wheel radius calculation. Default value is `0.002` (0.2%). Setting higher difference value may result inaccurate wheel radius reading.

    wheel_lock_threshold
Set percentage threshold for counting wheel lock duration under braking. `0.3` means 30% of tyre slip ratio.

    cornering_radius_sampling_interval
Set position sampling interval for cornering radius calculation. Value range in `5` to `100`. Default sampling interval is `10`, which is roughly 200ms interval between each recorded position. Higher value may result inaccuracy. Note, this option does not affect position recording interval.

    minimum_delta_distance
Set minimum recording distance (in meters) between each tyre wear sample. Default value is `5` meters. Lower value may result more samples recorded and bigger file size; higher value may result less samples recorded and inaccuracy. Recommended value range in `5` to `10` meters.

    enable_suspension_measurement_while_offroad
Enable suspension travel measurement while vehicle is offroad. This option should be disabled for road racing for more accurate suspension measurement. This option is disabled by default.

    average_suspension_position_samples
Set amount samples for calculating average suspension position, which helps to filter out unusual data. Default is `20`. Minimum value is limited to `3`.

    average_suspension_position_margin
Set additional margin that cannot exceed the sum of previous `average suspension position` and `margin`. This option is used to minimize the impact of unusual data. Default value is `1` millimeter. Minimum value is limited to `0.1`.

    wheel_lift_off_threshold
Set millimeter threshold of tyre vertical deflection for detecting lifted wheels. Suspension travel is not calculated from wheel that is lifted off the ground (as below the threshold). Default threshold is `1` millimeter. Set to `-1` to always calculate suspension travel even if wheel is lifted off.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


# Widgets
Each widget can be configured by accessing `Config` button from `Widget` tab in main window.

Widget context menu can be accessed by `Right-Click` on widget, which provides additional options:
- Center horizontally: align widget to the center of active screen horizontally.
- Center vertically: align widget to the center of active screen vertically.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Acceleration
**This widget displays acceleration timing info.**

This widget shows active, last, best, and delta acceleration time (in seconds) that measured from customizable target speed range. To reset best acceleration time, shift gear into reverse, or reload widget.

Note, timing precision is limited by `game API` and `update_interval`, which may not provide high decimal precision.

    layout
Set column horizontal display order. Set `0` to show from left to right. Set `1` to show from right to left instead.

    speed_range_*_start, speed_range_*_end
Set the start and end target speed values for measuring acceleration time. Speed value is defined in meter per second, and displayed according [Speed Units](#units) setting. To hide specific slot, set both target speed values to `0`.

Note, to properly count acceleration from `0` start speed, set slightly higher value such as `0.6` instead of '0', because vehicle in game will not be sitting perfectly still at 0 speed while stopped.

    speed_drop_threshold
Set threshold for detecting speed drop during acceleration timing, which cancels timing when speed dropped below threshold. Default is `1` m/s.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Battery
**This widget displays battery usage info.**

Note, there are some electric vehicles in `RF2` that are not based on the new electric motor and battery charge system, which there is no battery usage info available.

    show_battery_charge
Show percentage available battery charge.

    show_battery_drain
Show percentage battery charge drained in current lap.

    show_battery_regen
Show percentage battery charge regenerated in current lap.

    show_estimated_net_change
Show estimated battery charge net change from current lap. Positive value indicates net gain (regen higher than drain); negative indicates net loss (drain higher than regen).

Total net change reading is more accurate for vehicles that constantly consume battery charge, such as `FE` or `Hypercar` class. It is less useful for vehicles that only utilize electric motor for a short duration, such as `Push to pass`.

Note, at least one full lap (excludes pit-out or first lap) is required to generate estimated net change data.

    show_activation_timer
Show electric boost motor activation timer.

    high_battery_threshold, low_battery_threshold
Set percentage threshold for displaying low or high battery charge warning indicator. Default high threshold is `95` percent (default color purple), low threshold is `10` percent (default color red).

    show_battery_charge_warning_flash
Show battery charge warning flash effect when battery charge decreased below `low_battery_threshold` or increased above `high_battery_threshold`.

    number_of_warning_flashes
Set number of warning flashes that will be played for a limited number of times. Default is `10` flashes. Minimum value is limited to `3`.

    warning_flash_highlight_duration
Set color highlight duration for each warning flash. Default is `0.4` seconds. Minimum value is limited to `0.2`.

    warning_flash_interval
Set minimum time interval between each warning flash. Default is `0.4` seconds. Minimum value is limited to `0.2`.

    freeze_duration
Set freeze duration (seconds) for displaying previous lap total drained/regenerated battery charge after crossing finish line. Value range in `0` to `30` seconds. Default is `10` seconds.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Brake bias
**This widget displays brake bias info.**

    show_front_and_rear
Show both front and rear bias. Default is `false`.

    show_percentage_sign
Set `true` to show percentage sign for brake bias value.

    show_baseline_bias_delta
Show delta between current and baseline brake bias, which can be useful for keeping track of brake bias changes easier during a long race. Baseline brake bias is automatically set (and reset) while vehicle is stationary in pit lane or stationary during formation lap.

    show_brake_migration
Show real-time brake migration change, as commonly seen in LMH and LMDh classes.

Note, brake migration is calculated based on brake input and brake pressure telemetry data, and is affected by pedal force setting from car setup and electric braking allocation of specific vehicle.

To get accurate brake migration reading, it is necessary for brake pedal to reach fully pressed state for at least once while entering track to recalibrate brake pressure scaling for brake migration calculation. It is normally not required to do manually, as game's auto-hold brake assist is on by default. However if auto-hold brake assist is off, or the APP was reloaded while player was already on track, then it is required to do a full braking for at least once to get accurate brake migration reading.

    electric_braking_allocation
Set allocation for calculating brake migration under different electric braking allocation from specific vehicle. Note, vehicle that has not electric braking, or has disabled regeneration, is not affected by this option. Incorrect allocation value will result wrong brake migration reading from vehicle that has electric braking activated.

Set value to `-1` to enable auto-detection, which automatically checks whether electric braking is activated on either axles while braking, and sets allocation accordingly. This is enabled by default. Note, it may take a few brakes to detect correct allocation.

Set value to `0` to manual override and use front allocation, which is commonly seen in LMH class.

Set value to `1` to manual override and use rear allocation, which is commonly seen in LMDh class.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Brake performance
**This widget displays brake performance info.**

    show_transient_maximum_braking_rate
Show transient maximum braking rate (g) from last braking input, and resets after 3 seconds.

    show_maximum_braking_rate
Show maximum braking rate (g), and resets after a set period of time that defined by `maximum_braking_rate_reset_delay` value in Force Module.

    show_delta_braking_rate
Show maximum braking rate difference (g) against transient maximum braking rate, and resets on the next braking.

    show_delta_braking_rate_in_percentage
Show maximum braking rate difference (g) in percentage (%) instead.

    show_front_wheel_lock_duration, show_rear_wheel_lock_duration
Show maximum front and rear wheel lock duration (seconds) per lap under braking. Duration increases when tyre slip ratio has exceeded `wheel_lock_threshold` value that set in [Wheels Module](#wheels-module), and resets on first braking input of a new lap.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Brake pressure
**This widget displays visualized percentage brake pressure info.**

    show_brake_input
Show raw brake input on each brake. This option can be useful to check amount difference between brake input and applied brake pressure.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Brake temperature
**This widget displays brake temperature info.**

Note, if temperature drops below `-100` degrees Celsius, temperature readings will be replaced by unavailable sign as `-`. This usually indicates brake failure, or brake is not available on one of the wheels.

    layout
2 layouts are available: `0` = vertical layout, `1` = horizontal layout.

    enable_heatmap_auto_matching
Enable automatically heatmap style matching for specific brakes defined in `brakes.json` preset. This option applies matching heatmap style to front and rear brakes separately.

    heatmap_name
Set heatmap preset name that is defined in `heatmap.json` preset. Note, this option has no effect while `enable_heatmap_auto_matching` is enabled.

    swap_style
Swap heatmap color between font and background color.

    show_degree_sign
Set `true` to show degree sign for each temperature value.

    leading_zero
Set amount leading zeros for each temperature value. Default is `2`. Minimum value is limited to `1`.

    show_average
Show average brake temperature calculated from most recent braking period. The braking period is defined by `average_sampling_duration` and `off_brake_duration` options.

    average_sampling_duration
Set duration (seconds) for calculating average brake temperature from most recent braking period. Default is `10` seconds. Maximum duration is limited to `600` seconds.

    off_brake_duration
Set duration (seconds) for continuously updating average brake temperature for a short period after fully released brakes. Default is `1` seconds.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Brake wear
**This widget displays brake wear info.**

**Important notes:** Brake wear data is currently only available on `LMU`. `RF2` currently doesn't provide brake wear data. Depends on vehicle, brake may or may not have noticeable wear.

    layout
2 layouts are available: `0` = vertical layout, `1` = horizontal layout.

    show_thickness
Show brake thickness (millimeter) instead of percentage, which also affects wear difference readings.

Note, brake maximum thickness (for percentage wear calculation) is retrieved at the moment when car leaves garage or has brake repaired or changed. Reloading a preset or restarting APP in the middle of a running stint could result wrong maximum thickness and percentage wear calculation, which should be avoided.

**Notes to brake failure thickness:**

Brake failure thickness is millimeter thickness threshold at brake failure, which affects brake wear calculation accuracy, and can be customized for specific vehicle class in [Brake Editor](#brake-editor).

For example, if `brake thickness` is `40`mm, and `failure thickness` is `25`mm, then `effective thickness` is `40 - 25 = 15mm`. And brake fails upon reaching `25`mm thickness. Note, each installed brake may have a random failure thickness variation of `±0.1`mm.

Since brake failure thickness threshold data is not available from game API, it requires testing to find out, and may vary from vehicle to vehicle. Front brake failure thickness threshold can be different from rear brake. Thickness threshold value should not exceed brake maximum thickness, otherwise brake wear readings will not be displayed correctly.

Note, failure thickness values are automatically saved to `brakes.json` preset when brakes failed, and most recent brake failures are logged and can be found in [Show Log](#console-log) dialog from `Help` menu.

**Tips for testing failure thickness:**

Before start, make sure vehicle brand data is imported via [Vehicle Brand Editor](#vehicle-brand-editor). This is necessary to save brake failure thickness settings per vehicle brand.

First, set all `brake duct` settings to `closed` in car setup, then keeps brakes on while driving at around 100kph speed until brakes failed (use brake bias to control front and rear wear rate), and failure thickness value will be automatically saved for this vehicle. Be aware that testing may take a very long time for some vehicles.

    show_remaining
Show total remaining brake in percentage that changes color according to wear. A `FAIL` text will be shown on failed brakes.

    show_wear_difference
Show estimated brake wear difference per lap (at least one valid lap is required).

    show_live_wear_difference
Show current lap brake wear difference.

    show_lifespan_laps

## Fuel
**This widget displays fuel usage info.**

Note, for non-hybrid pure electric vehicle, this widget will show `battery charge` usage (in percentage) info instead. Since multiple different electric systems exist in `RF2`, there is no reliable way to distinguish pure electric vehicles from fuel or hybrid vehicles, it is important to make sure `fuel_unit` option in [Units](#units) setting is set to `Liter` in order to correctly display battery charge usage in `percentage` for pure electric vehicles.

---

Differences between `relative` and `absolute` refueling:

* Relative refueling value shows total amount `additional` fuel required to finish the remaining race length, which matches `relative refueling` mechanism (amount to add on top of remaining fuel in tank) in `RF2`.

* Absolute refueling value shows absolute total amount fuel required to finish the remaining race length, which matches `absolute refueling` mechanism (amount total fuel to fill tank up to) in `LMU`.

Also see `estimated laps` display option in [Session](#session) widget that can be used for `absolute refueling`.

---

    show_absolute_refueling
Show absolute refueling value instead of relative refueling when enabled. Note, `+` or `-` sign is not displayed with absolute refueling.

    show_estimated_pitstop_count
Show estimated number of pit stop counts column.

    show_delta_consumption_and_end_remaining
Show delta consumption and estimated end stint remaining fuel column.

    *remaining
Remaining fuel in tank.

    *refueling
Estimated refueling reading, which is the total amount additional fuel required to finish race.

Note, for `relative refueling` (`show_absolute_refueling` disabled), positive value indicates additional refueling and pit stop would be required, while negative value indicates total remaining fuel at the end of race, and no extra pit stop required. For example, a `-1.5` value indicates `1.5` remaining fuel after crossed finish line.

For `absolute refueling` (`show_absolute_refueling` enabled), total remaining fuel at the end of race can be found by subtracting `refuel` value from `remain` value. For example, `6` (remain column) - `4.5` (refuel column) = `1.5` remaining fuel after crossed finish line.

    *estimated_laps
Estimated laps reading that current fuel can last.

    *estimated_minutes
Estimated minutes reading that current fuel can last.

    *estimated_consumption
Estimated fuel consumption reading, which is calculated from last-valid-lap fuel consumption and delta fuel consumption. Note, when vehicle is in garage stall, this reading only shows last-valid-lap fuel consumption without delta calculation.

    *saving_target
Estimated fuel saving target consumption reading for making one less pit stop.

    *delta_consumption
Estimated delta fuel consumption reading. Positive value indicates an increase in consumption, while negative indicates a decrease in consumption.

    *end_remaining
Estimated remaining fuel reading at the end of current stint before next pit stop, which reflects fuel usage efficiency.

Note, this value does not count towards the end of race; instead, this value always counts towards the end of last completeable lap. To find out total remaining fuel at the end of race, see `refuel` column and explanation.

    *pitstop_count
Estimate number of pit stop counts when making a pit stop at end of current stint. Any non-zero decimal places would be considered for an additional pit stop.

    *early_pitstop_count
Estimate number of pit stop counts when making an early pit stop at end of current lap. This value can be used to determine whether an early pit stop is worth performing comparing to `pits` value.

Example 1: When this value is just below `1.0` (such as `0.97`), it indicates an early pit stop can be made right at the end of current lap with enough empty capacity to refuel according to `refuel` reading which would last to the end of race.

Example 2: When this value is just below `2.0` (such as `1.96`), and `pits` value is also in `1.x` range (such as `1.32`),  it indicates 2 required pit stops, and an early pit stop can be made right at the end of current lap with tank fully refueled according to `refuel` reading. After refueling, `pits` reading would show an approximately `0.96` value which indicates one more required pit stop.

Example 3: If this value is one or more integers higher than `pits` value, then additional pit stops would be required after making a pit stop at the end of current lap.

    bar_width
Set each column width, value in chars, such as 10 = 10 chars. Default is `5`. Minimum width is limited to `3`.

    low_fuel_lap_threshold
Set amount lap threshold to show low fuel indicator when total completable laps of remaining fuel is equal or less than this value. Default is `2` laps before running out of fuel.

Set number of target slots for more completable laps. Default is `3`. Range in `1` to `10`.

    number_of_less_laps
Set number of target slots for less completable laps. Default is `0`. Range in `0` to `5`.

    show_rate_of_consumption
Show fuel or energy consumption per second and current vehicle speed (meters per second) under `RATE` column.

This option shows how consumption rate changes with throttle, RPM, engine map, etc. It also helps to determine amount distance required to lift-and-coast to save corresponding amount fuel or energy.

For example, if energy consumption per second value is `0.05`, and current speed value is `75m`, it indicates it would take roughly 1 second and 75 meters of lift-and-coast time and distance to save 0.05 energy.

    enable_pit_entry_bias
Auto calibrate target fuel (or energy) saving bias towards either pit entry position or finish line, depending on number of estimated remaining pit stops.

This feature is made specially for tracks that have pit entry position located far away from finish line, which it is necessary to take pit entry position into fuel saving calculation for increased accuracy.

While enabled, a `BIAS` column will be displayed, which shows amount added fuel (or energy) bias towards pit entry position, as well as percentage pit entry bias from finish line, When bias is `0`, it means there is no pit entry bias added.

**Important notes:** Do not enable this feature if you are not sure what it does. You must enter pit at least once to record pit entry position of the track for this feature to work.

    remaining_pitstop_threshold
Set number of remaining pit stops threshold for auto calibrating target fuel (or energy) saving bias. Default value is `0.1`.

Fuel (or energy) saving calculation is biased towards pit entry position when number of estimated remaining pit stops is greater than the threshold, otherwise biased towards finish line.

## Laps and position
**This widget displays lap number, driver overall position, position in class info.**

    show_lap_number
Show your current lap number (lap progression) and total race laps. If total race laps is not available, such as in time-based session, estimated total laps will be displayed instead, and a `~` sign will be displayed before estimated total laps reading, and up to two decimal places will be kept.

Note, estimated total laps reading is calculated based on local player's lap time pace data from Delta Module, which can be different from in-game HUD reading. This reading does not concern about race leader's lap time pace, which means there may be an extra final lap on top of it.

**So why not show total laps prediction based on race leader's lap time pace?**

The reason is because there are too many variables that are outside of local player's control. Anything can happen to anyone on their last stint and last few laps.

For example, race leader might crash their car, or run out of fuel, or be overtaken by others, or lost connection to server on the last few laps, which means it is not reliable to base prediction on race leader's pace. More over, it can cause unnecessary confusion to user, who might wonder whether an extra final lap is already added (or not) to the total laps based on leader's pace.

Hence the prediction is only based on local player's (your own) pace.

**But how do I know whether there will be an extra final lap before race leader finished his last lap?**

You can determine the chance of an extra final lap by using [Relative Finish Order](#relative-finish-order) widget, which provides additional data for analyzing the chance of extra final lap.

## Relative finish order
**This widget displays estimated relative finish order between leader and local player with corresponding refilling estimate in a table view.**

**Overview**

This widget predicts `relative final lap progress` (percent into lap) at the moment when session timer ended in time-type race, or leader crossed finish line in laps-type race, which can be used to determine whether extra laps are required to finish race.

Simple example: in time-type race, at the moment when session timer ended, assume race leader's vehicle is in `Sector 1` (or 20% into lap), and local player is in `Sector 3` (or 80% into lap) which is ahead of leader in terms of `relative lap progress` (0% from start line to 100% at finish line). When local player finishes his current lap, the race does not end for him because leader is behind local player and has not yet crossed finish line. This means local player has to complete another lap in order to finish the race, and needs an extra lap of fuel.

---

The table consists of 5 fixed rows, 1 optional row, 3 fixed columns, and 10 optional prediction columns that can be customized. Example:

| TIME |   0s  |  30s  |  40s  |  50s  |  60s  |  54s  |
|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|  LDR |  0.49 |  0.20 |  0.11 |  0.02 |  0.92 |  0.98 |
| 0.04 |  0.91 |  0.64 |  0.55 |  0.46 |  0.37 |  0.51 |
| DIFF |   0s  |  30s  |  40s  |  50s  |  60s  |  43s  |
|  NRG | +18.1 | +18.1 | +18.1 | +18.1 | +18.1 | +18.1 |
| EX+1 | +20.3 | +20.3 | +20.3 | +20.3 | +20.3 | +20.3 |

First and fourth rows, starting from second cell, show estimated `leader's pit time` and `local player's pit time`, where first row first cell shows current session type in `TIME` or `LAPS`. Last cell shows last recorded total time that leader and local player had spent in pit. Note, last recorded total pit time counts from pit entry to pit exit point, it doesn't include the extra few seconds that spent while approaching or exiting from pit.

Second and third rows, starting from second cell, show estimated `leader's final lap progress` (fraction of lap) and `local player's final lap progress` that depend on current session type:
* For `TIME` type race, it shows final lap progress at the moment when session timer ended.
* For `LAPS` type race, it shows relative final total lap difference between leader and local player.
Leader's value from second row second cell always shows `integer value`, because laps-type race has no timer, and the end of race is determined at the moment when leader crossed finish line, which can only be full laps.
Local player's value from third row second cell always shows final lap progress relative to leader's value from second row second cell.
Both leader's and local player's `final lap progress` values starting from third cell are offset from second cell of same row.

Third row, first cell shows `relative lap difference` between leader and local player that is calculated from lap time pace difference of both players, which can be used to determine whether leader has the chance to overtake local player on final lap. For example:
* If relative lap difference value shows 0.25, that means for every full lap, leader is faster than local player by 0.25 lap. If leader is at start line and player is just within 0.25 lap distance from leader, that means leader can catch up and overtake player before the end of lap.
* If relative lap difference value shows 0.25 and leader is at middle of current lap (0.5 lap), that means leader now only has roughly half of the lap distance (0.12 lap) to make successful overtake before the end of lap. If player is not within this 0.12 lap distance, then leader may not be able to overtake.

Fifth row, first cell shows refilling type in `FUEL` or `NRG` (if virtual energy available). Starting from second cell, shows estimated `local player's refilling` that depends on current session type:
* For `TIME` type race, refilling value from each column is calculated based on local player's current `laptime pace`, `consumption`, and `local player's final lap progress` from third row of same column. Note, each refilling value has no relation to `leader's final lap progress` value from same column. Refilling value from `0s` column gives same reading as seen from `Fuel` or `Virtual Energy` Widget in time-type race.
* For `LAPS` type race, only refilling value from `0s` column is calculated and displayed according to leader's `leader's final lap progress` value.
Other column values are not displayed, this is done to avoid confusion. Because unlike `TIME` type race where all `final lap progress` values are within `0.0` to `1.0` range, in `LAPS` type race values can exceed `1.0` or below `0.0` (negative), which the number of possible lap differences would increase exponentially and not possible to list all of them in the widget.

Sixth row (optional), first cell shows `number of extra laps` for extra refilling display. Starting from second cell, shows estimated `extra refilling` value that depends on `local player's refilling` value and `number of extra laps` setting. Each extra refilling value equals `extra laps of consumption` plus `local player's refilling` value of same column. Those values save the trouble from manual calculation in case there will be extra laps.

See `TIME` or `LAPS` type race example usages below for details.

**Important notes**

* Prediction accuracy depends on many variables and is meant for final stint estimate. Such as laptime pace, pit time, penalties, weather condition, safety car, yellow flag, can all affect prediction accuracy. It requires at least 2-3 laps to get sensible readings, and more laps to have better accuracy.

* `Final lap progress` values will not be displayed if no corresponding valid lap time pace data found, which requires at least 1 or 2 laps to record. If local player is the leader, then all values from leader's row will not be displayed. Refilling values will not be displayed during formation lap for the reasons mentioned in first note.

* Refilling estimate calculation is different between `TIME` and `LAPS` type races, make sure to look at the correct value, check out `example usage` below for details.

* `LMU` currently uses `absolute refueling` mechanism (amount `total` fuel to fill tank up to), as opposite to relative fuel (amount to `add` on top of remaining fuel in tank). User can enabled `show_absolute_refilling` option to display total amount fuel/energy required (including fuel/energy in tank) to finish race.

**Time-type race example usage**

| TIME | 0s   | 30s  | 40s  | 50s  | 60s  | 0s   |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| LDR  | 0.38 | 0.10 | 0.01 | 0.91 | 0.82 | 0.38 |
| 0.11 | 0.72 | 0.47 | 0.39 | 0.31 | 0.22 | 0.37 |
| DIFF | 0s   | 30s  | 40s  | 50s  | 60s  | 43s  |
| FUEL | +7.4 | +7.4 | +7.4 | +7.4 | +7.4 | +7.4 |
| EX+1 | +11.2 | +11.2 | +11.2 | +11.2 | +11.2 | +11.2 |

1. Determine leader's next pit time and select `leader's final lap progress` (second row) value from corresponding pit time (first row) column. `0s` column means no pit stop.

2. Determine local player's next pit time and select `local player's final lap progress` (third row) value from corresponding pit time (fourth row) column.

3. Compare the two `final lap progress` values from leader and local player, assume fuel per lap is `3.8`:

    * If leader's `final lap progress` value is greater than local player, such as leader's 0.91 (50s column) vs player's 0.47 (30s column), it indicates that leader will be ahead of local player when timer ended, and there will be no extra final lap. So `local player's refilling` value from corresponding `30s` column can be used, in this case, it's `+7.4` fuel to add.
    However, if leader is closer to finish line (as show in orange color indicator), there is a chance that leader may be fast enough to cross finish line before the end of timer, which would result an extra final lap for local player, and requires adding an extra lap of fuel (`3.8`) on top of `+7.4` fuel. In this case it would be `+11.2` refuel, or you can simply look at the refuel value from `extra refilling row` of same column.

    * If local player's `final lap progress` value is greater than leader, such as leader's 0.10 (30s column) vs player's 0.39 (40s column), it indicates that local player will be ahead of leader when timer ended, and there will be an extra final lap for local player, and here again requires adding an extra lap of fuel (`3.8`) on top of `+7.4` fuel from `40s` column, which is `+11.2` refuel.
    However, if the difference between the two `final lap progress` values is smaller than `relative lap difference` (from third row first cell) value, it may indicate that leader could overtake local player on final lap, which would result no extra final lap.

4. To sum up, if comparison shows no extra final lap, then just refill according to `local player's refilling` (fifth row) value from the same column of `local player's final lap progress` (third row). If comparison shows an extra final lap, then just add an extra lap of fuel on top of `local player's refilling` value; or, just look at the refuel value from `extra refilling row` of same column.


**Laps-type race example usage**

Note, there is generally no reason to use this widget in `LAPS` type race unless you are doing multi-class laps-type race which is very rarely seen.

| LAPS | 0s    | 30s  | 40s   | 50s   | 60s   | 0s   |
|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|
| LDR  | 2.00  | 1.57 | 1.43  | 1.28  | 1.14  | 2.00 |
| 0.11 | 0.40  | 0.02 | -0.11 | -0.24 | -0.37 | 0.40 |
| DIFF | 0s    | 30s  | 40s   | 50s   | 60s   | 43s  |
| FUEL | +12.8 | -    | -     | -     | -     | -    |
| EX+1 | +15.0 | -    | -     | -     | -     | -    |

1. Determine leader's next pit time and select `leader's final lap progress` (second row) value from corresponding pit time (first row) column. `0s` means no pit stop.

2. Determine local player's next pit time and select `local player's final lap progress` (third row) value from corresponding pit time (fourth row) column.

3. Subtract `local player's final lap progress` value from `leader's final lap progress`, then round down value:

    * If leader's `final lap progress` value is 2.00 (0s column), and local player's `final lap progress` value is 0.40 (0s column), then after subtracting (2 - 0.4 = 1.6) and rounding down, the final value is `1` lap difference, which means local player will do `one less lap` than leader.
    As mentioned earlier, for laps-type race, refilling value from `0s column` is calculated according to leader's `leader's final lap progress` value, which any lap difference is already included in the result from `local player's refilling` value (fifth row second cell), in this case, it's `+12.8` fuel to add.

    * If leader's `final lap progress` value is 1.43 (40s column), and local player's `final lap progress` value is -0.24 (50s column), then after subtracting (1.43 - -0.24 = 1.67) and rounding down, the final value is also `1` lap difference, which means local player will do the same `one less lap` than leader. So in this case, it's still `+12.8` fuel to add.

    * If leader's `final lap progress` value is 2.00 (0s column), and local player's `final lap progress` value is -0.11 (40s column), then after subtracting (2 - -0.11 = 2.11) and rounding down, the final value is `2` lap difference, which means local player will do `two less laps` than leader. So an extra lap of fuel may be removed from `local player's refilling` value from fifth row second cell, in this case, it's `12.8` minus one lap of fuel `2.2`, equals `+10.6` fuel to add. Alternatively, it can be calculated from full lap refuel (as show in Fuel Widget), which will be `15.0` minus two lap of fuel `4.4`, and equals `+10.6` fuel to add.
    Be aware that carrying less fuel is risky in laps-type race due to reasons below.

4. Last note, since the end of laps-type race is determined by the moment that leader completed all race laps, leader can greatly affect final prediction outcome. To give an extreme example, if leader is ahead of everyone by a few laps, and decides to wait a few minutes on his final lap before finish line, then everyone else will be catching up and do a few `extra laps` which would require more fuel. Thus it is always risky to carry less fuel in laps-type race.

    show_best_laptime
Show driver's session best lap time.

    show_best_laptime_from_recent_laps_in_race
Show driver's best lap time from (five) most recent laps in race session. This option provides a better view of driver's recent performance during longer race.

    show_average_laptime
Show driver's average lap time calculated from (five) most recent laps.

    show_delta_laptime
Show lap time difference (delta) between player and opponents from most recent laps (up to 5 recent lap time records). The default layout order shows delta lap time records from right side column (most recent lap) to left.

A green color (default) delta indicates that player's recent lap time is faster than opponent, while orange color delta indicates the opposite.

    show_inverted_delta_laptime_layout
Enable this option to invert layout order for delta lap time records.

    number_of_delta_laptime
Set number of delta lap time records to display. Minimum number is limited to `2`, maximum is limited to `5`.

    show_stint_laps
Show number of completed laps from current stint and estimated total stint laps. Note, it may require a few laps to get accurate estimate.

    show_energy_remaining
Show remaining virtual energy reading in percentage from each driver, with 4 different states:
- Unavailable: virtual energy reading is not available currently, default color grey.
- High: above 30% remaining, default color green.
- low: from 30% to 10% remaining, default color orange.
- critical: 10% or lower remaining, default color red.

Note, for vehicle without virtual energy, remaining fuel (only if available) will be displayed instead. If fuel data is not available from game API, then nothing will be displayed.

**Known limitation with remaining virtual energy readings**

Currently, remaining virtual energy data from `LMU's Rest API` is updated only when driver completes a lap, which means the data from API will not change during a lap, but only at the moment a lap is done by a driver. And due to this, the data will not tell how much energy was refilled in pit until the driver finished his pit-out lap. This makes the data less useful by itself.

To workaround this API limitation, a special interpolation algorithm is implemented, which enables accurate estimates to remaining energy progressively during a lap for each driver. The average accuracy of estimation is within 1%.

Some cases where interpolation may not be applied:
- Interpolation may require at least 1 full lap (not counting pit-out lap) done before it can take effect.
- During pit stop, refilled energy reading may not be updated until driver finishes his pit-out lap (as mentioned earlier), which means old energy reading persists during pit-out lap and would result wrong estimates with interpolation. For this reason, interpolation is disabled during pit-out lap.

In either case, just wait another lap and energy readings will be synchronized.

    energy_remaining_decimal_places
Set additional decimals to be displayed.

**Important notes on decimal place accuracy:**

Currently due to known limitation from game API (as explained in User Guide), energy remaining readings from game API does not grant decimal place accuracy. The margin of error from this option can be as high as 1.0% per lap, which may not provide more accuracy than without decimals.

    show_vehicle_integrity
Show opponent vehicle integrity reading.

The integrity reading is calculated from hull damage, detachable wheels and parts, and displayed as:
- Full integrity (no damage), as `-` (default color grey).
- High integrity (lightly damaged hull), from `9` to `5` (default color blue).
- Low integrity (severely damaged hull, and most likely has detached wheels or parts), from `4` to `0` (default color red).

    show_incidents
Show total number of incidents for each driver from current session. This option helps tracking opponent's safeness and cleanness during long race. This option only works for `LMU`.

Note, incidents are counted from vehicle contacts and track cuts only for each individual driver. Incidents are not counted towards team. Incidents are only counted while this APP is running, and reset if changed session or restarted this APP.

    incidents_high_threshold, incidents_extreme_threshold
Set threshold for showing color indication when number of incidents are equal or above.

    show_speed_trap
Show fastest recorded speed of each driver per lap at user-defined speed trap position on track. This option can be useful to keep track of each driver's straight line performance from most recent lap.

Note, speed trap position is defined in `tracks.json` preset, which can be customized via [Track Info Editor](#track-info-editor). Default speed trap position is set at start/finish line.

    show_lift_and_coast_time
Show most recent recorded lift and coast time (in seconds) from each driver.

    lift_and_coast_reset_threshold
Set time threshold (in seconds) for resetting recent recorded lift and coast time. Default is `60` seconds.

    display_orientation
Set track map display orientation in degrees. For example, a `270` value will rotate map by `270` degrees clockwise. Default value is `0`, which always displays track map `North Up` in game's coordinate system.

    display_detail_level
Sets detail level for track map. Default value is `1`, which auto adjusts map detail according to display size. Higher value reduces map detail and RAM usage, and may also help reduce rough edges from large map. Set to `0` for full detail.

    vehicle_scale, vehicle_scale_player, vehicle_scale_safety_car
Set vehicle scale that multiplies base vehicle size. Note, base vehicle size is determined by `font size` and `bar padding`. Minimum scale is limited to `1.0`.

    area_size
Set area display size.

    area_margin
Set area margin size.

    show_background
Show widget background.

    enable_multi_class_styling
Show vehicles in multi-class color styles on map instead. Multi-class color can be customized from [Vehicle Class Editor](#vehicle-class-editor).

Note, while multi-class styling is enabled, following color styles will not be displayed:
`vehicle_color_player`, `vehicle_color_leader`, `vehicle_color_same_lap`, `vehicle_color_laps_ahead`, `vehicle_color_laps_behind`.

    show_custom_player_color_in_multi_class
Show custom player vehicle color (defined in `vehicle_color_player` option) while `enable_multi_class_styling` option is enabled.

    show_position_in_class
Show position in class while `enable_multi_class_styling` option is also enabled, otherwise this option has no effect.

    show_lap_difference_outline
Show outline color based on lap difference (ahead or behind) between player and opponents. This option is disabled by default.

    show_safety_car
Show safety car position on map if available. This option currently only works in RF2.

Note, safety car position data from RF2 API is fairly limited, and has a very low update rate, in order to workaround API limitation, safety car position data is interpolated to display smoothly, but may still desync occasionally.

    safety_car_text
Set custom text for safety car. Default is `SC`.

    show_pitout_prediction
Show estimated pit-out on-track position indication for each pit stop duration. Default indication shows `circle` with `pit stop duration` displayed above.

Note, pit-out position prediction is based on `delta best` data which scaled with player's latest `lap time pace` for accurate real-time position prediction under various track conditions. Pit-out prediction requires both valid `track map` and `delta best` data to display. At least `one valid lap` for any car and track combo is required to display pit-out prediction.

For accurate prediction, the location of `pit-out line` must be found first. And since each track has different pit-out line location, it is required to `pit-out` at least `once per session` to mark the correct pit-out line location. This can be easily done by driving out of pit lane.

    show_pitout_prediction_while_requested_pitstop
Show estimated pit-out on-track position indication while player has requested pit stop and not in pit lane.

    number_of_prediction
Set number of pit-out prediction to display. Value range is limited in `1` to `20`.

    pitout_time_offset
Set amount time offset (in seconds) for catching up with vehicle speed after pit-out. Default is `3` seconds.

Note, this value is important for accurate prediction, as initial vehicle speed is much slower after pit-out, so extra time is needed for driver to catch up, and also affected by pit-out line location. For most tracks, this extra time after pit-out is roughly within `1` to `5` seconds.

    pitout_duration_minimum
Set pit stop duration (in seconds) of first prediction. This option has no effect if `enable_fixed_pitout_prediction` is enabled.

    pitout_duration_increment
Set each pit stop duration (in seconds) increment after previous prediction. Default increment is `10` seconds. This option has no effect if `enable_fixed_pitout_prediction` is enabled.

Note, each time when pit stop duration of the nearest prediction exceeded current pit stop timer, the prediction circle will be removed, and a new prediction circle will be appended with pit stop duration increment after the last prediction.

    enable_auto_pitout_prediction
Show auto-estimated pit-out duration prediction. Default indication shows as a green circle. This option does not count towards `number_of_prediction` limit.

Auto estimated pit-out duration is calculated in the same way as [Pit Stop Estimate](#pit-stop-estimate) Widget.

Note, this option only works for `LMU`, and `enable_restapi_access` must be enabled in [LMU API](#le-mans-ultimate-api) setting.

    auto_prediction_additional_pitstop_time
Set additional pit stop time it takes to decelerate and accelerate towards and away from pit spot. This option corresponds to `additional_pitstop_time` option from `Pit stop estimate` Widget, and both should be set to same amount. Default value is `2` seconds.

    enable_fixed_pitout_prediction
Show pit-out prediction based on user-defined fixed pitstop duration instead. This option overrides `pitout_duration_minimum` and `pitout_duration_increment` options.

While this option is enabled, total pit-out duration is calculated from the sum of `pit-out time offset`, `fixed pit stop duration` and `estimated pit lane pass-through duration`. It's required to enter and exit pit lane at least once to get correct total pit-out duration.

    fixed_pitstop_duration
Set fixed amount pit stop duration (in seconds). Note, only `stopped` time should be considered for this option. Set to `0` if only passing through pit lane (such as `Drive Through`). Set to `-1` to disable this option.

    show_pitstop_duration
Show pit stop duration reading on top of each prediction circle.

Show absolute refilling value instead of relative refilling when enabled. Note, `+` or `-` sign is not displayed with absolute refilling.

    show_fuel_ratio_and_bias
Show fuel ratio and fuel bias column.

    *fuel_ratio
Show fuel ratio between estimated fuel and energy consumption, which can help balance fuel and energy usage, as well as providing refueling reference for adjusting pit stop `Fuel ratio` during race.

    *fuel_bias
Show fuel bias (unit in laps) that calculated from estimated laps difference between fuel and virtual energy.

Positive value indicates more laps can be run on fuel than virtual energy; in other words, virtual energy will deplete sooner than fuel. For example, a value of `+1.5` indicates that there will be `1.5 laps` of extra fuel remaining after virtual energy depleted.

Note, depleting virtual energy could result a `Stop-Go` penalty in `LMU`; while running out of fuel means no power for vehicle and would result retirement from race. So it is a good idea to keep fuel bias close to `0.0`, and slightly towards positive side to avoid depleting fuel before virtual energy.

## Weather
**This widget displays weather info.**

    show_temperature
Show track and ambient temperature.

    decimal_places_temperature
Set amount decimal places to keep. Default is `1` decimal place, set to `0` to hide decimals. Note, when number of digits is less than expected, extra leading zero or decimal place will be added to fill the gap.

    show_rain
Show rain precipitation in percentage.

    show_wetness
Show average surface wetness in percentage.

    show_rubber_coverage_while_dry
Show rough estimate of rubber coverage (percent) based on total number of laps done by all drivers while road surface is dry.

Note, rubber coverage reading may not be accurate during `practice session` in multiplayer, as some API data will be lost or reset while people joining or leaving server. This does not affect `qualifying` and `race` session.

| Rubber Coverage | Equivalent Grip | Equivalent Laps (LMU) | Equivalent Laps (RF2) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0.0 (0%) | Green | 0+ | 0+ |
| 0.25 (25%) | Light | 600+ | 300+ |
| 0.5 (50%) | Medium |  1200+ | 600+ |
| 0.75 (75%) | Heavy (High) | 2000+ (Median) | 1000+ (Median) |
| 1.0 (100%) | Saturated | 4000+ | 2000+ |

**Note, all data from above table are rough estimate based on testing.*

    rubber_median_laps
Set median laps at the point when grip becomes `Heavy (High)` for calculating accurate rubber coverage. Default median laps is `2000`. This value may vary from different games, see above table for reference.

    rubber_time_scale_*
Set time scale multiplier for calculating rubber coverage in corresponding sessions (practice, qualifying, race). This value should match `Realroad Time Scale` session setting from game. For `static` rubber, set time scale to `0`.

Note, since Realroad Time Scale data is not available from game API, it is required to manually set the value.

Most online servers use default `1.0` Realroad Time Scale setting during `qualifying` and `race` session, while some servers may use `static` setting during `practice` session only.

    starting_rubber_*
Set starting rubber coverage (percent) in corresponding sessions (practice, qualifying, race).

Note, since session starting rubber coverage data is not available from game API, it is required to manually set the value.

    show_trend
Show weather change trend for temperature, raininess, surface wetness readings.

    temperature_trend_interval, raininess_trend_interval, wetness_trend_interval
Set weather change trend interval in seconds. Default interval is `60` seconds.

If weather readings increased within the interval, `▲` uparrow sign will be shown; if readings decreased within the interval, `▼` downarrow sign will be shown; If readings has not changed during the interval, `●` sign will be shown after.

## Weather forecast
**This widget displays weather forecast info.**

    layout
2 layouts are available: `0` = show columns from left to right, `1` = show columns from right to left. Note, the `now` column always shows current weather condition.

    show_estimated_time
Show estimated time reading for upcoming weather. Note, estimated time reading only works in time-based race. Other race type such as lap-based race shows `n/a` instead.

    show_ambient_temperature
Show estimated ambient temperature reading for upcoming weather. Note, the `now` column always shows current ambient temperature instead.

    show_rain_chance_bar
Show visualized rain chance bar reading for upcoming weather. Note, the `now` column always shows current raininess instead.

    show_rain_chance_reading
Show rain chance reading in percentage.

    number_of_forecasts
Set number of forecasts to display. Value range in `1` to `4`. Default is `4` forecasts.

    show_unavailable_data
Show columns with unavailable weather data. Set `False` to auto hide columns with unavailable data. Note, auto hide only works for time-based race.

## Weight distribution
**This widget displays weight distribution info.**

Note, to get accurate static weight distribution readings, test setup on level ground.

Weight distribution is calculated from tyre load data, which may not be available from certain vehicles in game API (such as LMGT3).

To workaround this limitation, suspension load data, while not entirely the same, will be used for calculation instead.

    show_front_to_rear_distribution
Show front to rear weight distribution in percentage.

    show_left_to_right_distribution
Show left to right weight distribution in percentage.

    show_cross_weight
Show cross weight (known as `wedge`) in percentage.

    smoothing_samples
Set number of samples for reducing data fluctuation. Lower value may result more fluctuated reading. Set `1` to disable smoothing.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Wheel camber
**This widget displays wheel camber info.**

Note, all camber readings are in degrees.

    show_camber_difference
Show camber difference between left and right wheel on the same axle, useful for quickly checking misalignment while driving.

    camber_smoothing_samples, camber_difference_smoothing_samples
Set number of samples for reducing data fluctuation. Lower value may result more fluctuated reading. Set `1` to disable smoothing.

[**`Back to Top`**](#)


## Wheel toe
**This widget displays wheel toe info.**

Note, all toe readings are in degrees. Positive reading indicates toe-in; negative indicates toe-out.

    show_total_toe_angle
Show total toe angle between left and right wheel on the same axle, useful for quickly checking amount total toe angle while driving.

    toe_in_smoothing_samples, total_toe_angle_smoothing_samples
Set number of samples for reducing data fluctuation. Lower value may result more fluctuated reading. Set `1` to disable smoothing.
