## Requirements

### Supported Sims

| API | Windows | Linux |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Le Mans Ultimate | No plugin required | Requires third-party plugin |
| rFactor 2 | rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin | rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin(Wine) |
| Assetto Corsa | TinyPedalConnector | TinyPedalConnector |

### Display Mode

Game display mode must be set to `Borderless` or `Windowed` to show overlay. `Fullscreen` mode is not supported.

### Setup for Le Mans Ultimate

#### Windows

* There is no plugin required for accessing LMU's built-in API on Windows. However, make sure `Enable Plugins` option is turned `ON` from in game `Settings` -> `Gameplay` page.

#### Linux

* LMU's built-in API can be selected on Linux, but may require third-party plugin to access, see [discussion #9](https://github.com/TinyPedal/TinyPedal/issues/9) for info.

### Setup for rFactor 2

TheIronWolf's [rF2 Shared Memory Map Plugin](https://github.com/TheIronWolfModding/rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin) is required for accessing `rFactor 2` API.

#### Windows

* Download the plugin from:\
https://github.com/TheIronWolfModding/rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin#download

#### Linux

* Download the forked plugin for Wine from:\
https://github.com/schlegp/rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin_Wine/blob/master/build

#### Install plugin

The plugin file is named `rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll` and should be placed in `rFactor 2\Bin64\Plugins` folder.

Note, manually create this `Plugins` folder if it is missing.

#### Enable plugin in game

In game `Settings` -> `Gameplay` page, find `Plugins` section and toggle on `rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll`.

After plugin enabled, must `restart game` to take effect.

Note, if game cannot generate `rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll` entry in `CustomPluginVariables.JSON` file, make sure `VC12 (Visual C++ 2013) runtime` is installed, which can be found in game's `Support\Runtimes` folder.

### Setup for Assetto Corsa

#### Windows

To export the required telemetry data from AC over shared memory, the addon Custom Shaders Patch is required, and an included Lua app `TinyPedalConnector` is required to be installed into AC. 

The app will be run automatically in the background once installed, and its window does not need to be open for it to run.

## Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure required plugins for specific game are installed according to [Requirements](#requirements).

## Run from Source

### Dependencies:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10
* PySide2
* pyLMUSharedMemory
* pyRfactor2SharedMemory
* pyACSharedMemory
* psutil

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to check Python version before installing additional dependencies.
>
> PySide2 may not be available for Python version higher than 3.10; or requires PySide6 instead for running with newer Python version. PySide6 is currently supported only via command line argument, see [Command Line Arguments](https://github.com/TinyPedal/TinyPedal/wiki/User-Guide#command-line-arguments) in User Guide for details.

### Download source code

#### Method 1

Download TinyPedal source code from [Releases](https://github.com/TinyPedal/TinyPedal/releases) page; or click `Code` button at the top of repository and select `Download ZIP`.

Download submodule source code from following links:
- pyLMUSharedMemory: https://github.com/TinyPedal/pyLMUSharedMemory
- pyRfactor2SharedMemory: https://github.com/TinyPedal/pyRfactor2SharedMemory
- pyACSharedMemory: https://github.com/ohyeah2389/pyACSharedMemory note: replace this with TinyPedal's fork if and once it is created

Extract TinyPedal source code ZIP file. Then extract submodule ZIP files and put them in corresponding folder in the root folder of TinyPedal.

#### Method 2

Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) tool and run following command to clone TinyPedal source code alongside required submodules:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TinyPedal/TinyPedal.git
```

To update submodules, run command:
```
git submodule update --init
```

Since `master` branch is the development branch, it may not be stable for normal use. You may switch to specific released version instead, such as `v2.45.0`, run command:
```
git checkout tags/v2.45.0
```

And to switch back to development branch, run:
```
git checkout master
```

### Setup development environment

It is recommended to setup an isolated development environment for running and testing code, especially useful if multiple different versions of Python are installed.

To start, make sure required Python version was installed. Currently the primary supported Python version is `3.8`, which is used in this example.

First, we need to create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). On windows, run following command in `Powershell` (replace the last part to your preferred path, either relative or absolute path):

```
py -3.8 -m venv '.virtualenvs\tinypedal_py38'
```

Then run following command to activate this virtual environment:

```
.virtualenvs\tinypedal_py38\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

Once activated, you can continue with [Install dependencies](#install-dependencies) section to install required package for this virtual environment, and running or building TinyPedal inside this virtual environment.

Finally, remember to activate this virtual environment (if haven't already) before installing packages or running the code.

### Install dependencies

Install additional dependencies by using command:
```
pip3 install PySide2 psutil
```

To start TinyPedal, type command from project root folder:
```
python run.py
```

## Build Executable for Windows

Executable file can be built with [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org).

To install py2exe, run command:
```
pip3 install py2exe
```

To build executable file, run command:
```
python freeze_py2exe.py
```

After building completed, executable file can be found in `dist\TinyPedal` folder.

> [!NOTE]
> The build script only supports py2exe `v0.12.0.0` or higher. The build script does not support PySide6.

## Running on Linux

The procedure described in the [Run from Source](#run-from-source) section is mostly valid,
except some differences in the dependencies, and that no executable can be
built. The differences are explained here.

Configuration and data files will be stored in the defined user-specific
directories, default to:
```
$HOME/.config/TinyPedal/
$HOME/.local/share/TinyPedal/
```

The required Python packages are `PySide2`, `psutil` and `pyxdg`. Most distros
name the package with a prefix, like `python3-pyside2`, `python3-psutil` and
`python3-pyxdg`.

Some distros split `PySide2` in subpackages. If you don't find
`python3-pyside2` then you should install `python3-pyside2.qtgui`,
`python3-pyside2.qtwidgets` and `python3-pyside2.qtmultimedia`.

Alternatively, you can install them using `pip3` but this will bypass your
system package manager and it isn't the recommended option. The command to
install the dependencies with this method is:
```
pip3 install PySide2 psutil pyxdg
```

To start TinyPedal type the following command:
```
./run.py
```

### Installation

Once you have a working instance of TinyPedal, created using the git command or
by unpacking the Linux release file, you can run the install script to install
or update TinyPedal on your system.

The install script will create a desktop launcher and will make `TinyPedal`
available as a command from the terminal.

The files will be installed at the `/usr/local/` prefix. You'll need
appropriate permissions to write there, for example, by using `sudo`.

You can run the script as (it doesn't support any arguments or options):
```sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

If you need persistent launch arguments (for example, to force PySide6), create
`~/.config/TinyPedal/launcher.conf` with:

```sh
TINYPEDAL_RUN_ARGS="--pyside 6"
```

The installed launcher and desktop entry will read this file automatically. This is mainly useful for ArchLinux where `PySide2` is deprecated.

### Known issues

- Some features may not be available on Linux currently.
- Widgets don't appear over the game window in KDE. Workaround: enable `Bypass Window Manager` option in `Compatibility` dialog from `Config` menu in main window.
- Transparency of widgets doesn't work when desktop compositing is disabled. Workaround: enable `window manager compositing` in your Desktop Environment.
